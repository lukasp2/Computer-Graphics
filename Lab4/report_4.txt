combined_shapes.wrl:
	some flying creature with a horn.
	
	A half plane is used to make its belly flat.
	A cylinder is used to "cut" the cone into the right size to
	make a horn. 
	An ellipsoid is used to remove a part of its body to make a mouth.
	
	The shape should render within 5 seconds, at least it does on my computer. 
	The other shapes not included in the lab requirements may of course slow down 
	the process a tad.

the other files are just for testing and playing around.
