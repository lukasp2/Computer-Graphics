Formula_number_1: 30 - 26 = 4.
(actually number 80 on the list if I remember correctly, but 
-50 since the list started at 50, so 30).

Formula_number_2: 4 + 3 = 7.

Form_1_surface.wrl:
	number 4 of the surfaces on the list.

Form_2_surface.wrl:
	number 7 of the surfaces on the list, but where
	the definition of x is switched with that of z to
	make the morphing cooler. 

forms_morphing: 
	the two forms morphing from one to the other.
	
own_morphing.wrl:
